            <h1>You're not being intercepted by HTTP Toolkit</h1>
            <p>This response came from a real server, and wasn't intercepted by HTTP Toolkit.</p>
            <p>
                If you're trying to use HTTP Toolkit, that means something isn't configured quite right.
                Make sure the proxy settings in your browser (or other HTTP client) match your HTTP Toolkit
                settings. You can check the settings in the 'Manual Setup' option on the Intercept page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're not trying to use HTTP Toolkit, then you're all good. You can
                try it out though if you're interested at <a href="https://httptoolkit.tech">HttpToolkit.tech</a>.
