            <h1>You're not being intercepted by HTTP Toolkit</h1>
            <p>This response came from a real server, and wasn't intercepted by HTTP Toolkit.</p>
            <p><strong>If you're trying to use HTTP Toolkit, this means that something is configured incorrectly.</strong></p>
            <p>
                Make sure the proxy settings in your browser (or other HTTP client) match your HTTP Toolkit
                settings. You can check the settings in the 'Anything' option on the Intercept page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're not trying to use HTTP Toolkit, then you're all good, and you don't need to worry about this.
                You can try it out though if you're interested at <a href="https://httptoolkit.tech">HttpToolkit.tech</a>.
